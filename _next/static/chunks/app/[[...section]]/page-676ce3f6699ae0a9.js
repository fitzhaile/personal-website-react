Measuring people rather than organizations avoids bias from uneven firm sizes.\n\n- Penetration within this industry was weak relative to the local economy\n- Small current footprint implies significant headroom despite niche size\n- Attractive average salaries increase the value of potential penetration gains\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n### Donors & Individual Giving {.case-study__section-title}\n\nDonor participation reflects the percent of people within accounts who give. Percentages are volatile at small counts but still directional. Leadership donors often require more time per relationship and can materially affect totals.\n\n- Donor participation and counts were low; leadership share among donors was high\n- Leadership gifts can represent a large portion of individual revenue\n- Small denominators amplify percentage swings; interpret trends with caution\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n### Corporate Giving {.case-study__section-title}\n\nCorporate gifts and matches vary by industry and are often decided by headquarters. They increasingly incentivize participation and can materially shift totals even when donor counts are small.\n\n- Corporate participation was limited but impactful where present\n- Matching policies can be a lever for new or increased participation\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n### Payroll & Giving Potential {.case-study__section-title}\n\nTotal payroll indicates scale; giving potential per employee estimates headroom using typical giving rates (e.g., ~1–2% of income), consistent with observed averages.\n\n- Higher-than-average wages suggest above-average per-employee potential\n- Combined with low current penetration, the opportunity is attractive\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n### Conclusion {.case-study__section-title}\n\nThis industry is relatively small but offers clear headroom: higher wages, weak current penetration, and leadership‑gift patterns seen in adjacent fields all point to actionable opportunity.\n\n- Focus early outreach on targeted establishments with capacity and leadership prospects\n- Use consistent industry metrics and annual refresh to track movement\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n### Services & Artifacts {.case-study__section-title}\n\n- Donor & Industry Insight: Unified structure connecting donor and business data\n- Systems & Process Optimization: Materials leaders can use in planning\n- Data Management & Quality Control: Updatable dataset for annual refresh\n- Industry brief with sector rankings and rationale\n- Prioritized lead list for campaign development (existing accounts removed)\n- Scoring workbook for sector comparison and opportunity review\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n "}},{slug:"google-analytics",title:"Google Analytics & Campaign Insight",content:"Measure what matters, translating web and campaign data into meaningful results.\n\n- Measure campaign performance via acquisition and funnel analysis in Google Analytics.\n- Build backend Google Analytics infrastructure for a new fundraising platform.\n- Create performance reports to guide marketing and outreach decisions.",hasCaseStudy:!0,caseStudy:{subtitle:"Building a Marketing Analytics Framework",content:"### Challenge {.case-study__section-title}\n\nAs digital presence expanded across multiple properties, the team needed a single, reliable view of acquisition, behavior, and conversions—moving beyond basic traffic into data that could drive confident decisions.\n\n- Campaign data lived across multiple platforms and needed integration into one view\n- Standardized conversion tracking and funnel analysis were required\n- Cross-site user journeys had to be connected for complete attribution\n- Decisions needed to be grounded in consistent, accessible data\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n### Approach {.case-study__section-title}\n\nBuilt a comprehensive, event-based analytics foundation: consistent conversion tracking, funnel analysis, cross-site attribution, and accessible dashboards used in everyday planning.\n\n\n#### Event Configuration & Conversions {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\n- Implemented custom twenty to twenty-five GA4 events for donations, ticketing, form entry, engagement, etc. \n- Based primary conversions on purchase events;

The organization was ready to move from individualized workflows to a shared communication and project management approach that could scale with their growth.\n\nAs the organization had evolved, each team had developed its own practices—methods that served their immediate needs but created opportunities for better coordination across departments. Leadership recognized that establishing shared systems would accelerate collaboration and make organizational knowledge more accessible to everyone.\n\n- Communication happened through various channels, and the team wanted a central hub for project discussions.\n- Each department had developed its own project tracking approach, creating an opportunity to establish shared standards.\n- The organization was ready to implement consistent task ownership and status visibility across all teams.\n- Growing staff size called for standardized tools and workflows that would simplify onboarding and collaboration.\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n### Approach {.case-study__section-title}\n\nThe organization introduced a unified "operating system" for teamwork. Slack became the space for discussion, and Monday.com became the space for action. A few key standards connected the two, keeping communication simple and work transparent.\n\n#### Platform Selection and Design {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\n- **Slack:** Centralized real-time and asynchronous discussion in channels; searchable history replaced long email threads.\n- **Monday.com:** Standardized boards and templates with defined roles, timelines, and status updates.\n- **Guidelines:** A concise "When to use what" one-pager clarified when to use Slack, Monday.com, email, or text.\n- **Standards:** Lightweight norms around task assignment, notifications, and file sharing kept teams consistent without adding bureaucracy.\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n#### Template Development {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\nBuilt three Monday.com templates—General, Events, and Training—with standardized columns, groups, and statuses that could be used across all departments.\n\n- Created consistent channel naming conventions in Slack.\n- Clarified DM vs. channel use and set norms for tagging and mentions.\n- Developed training board for hands-on learning without affecting live projects.\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n#### Day-to-Day Impact {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\nAdoption of the new structure brought a noticeable shift in how teams worked together. Communication became more open, project tracking more predictable, and collaboration less dependent on specific individuals.\n\n- Teams shifted most project conversations into Slack channels, keeping discussion tied to relevant work.\n- Project boards used shared templates, so every department followed a similar layout.\n- Clear task ownership reduced confusion around accountability and next steps.\n- Saved views and filters gave everyone—from contributors to managers—a real-time snapshot of progress.\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n#### Implementation {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\nImplementation was done gradually, focusing on learning and consistency rather than speed. Each stage helped build shared habits and confidence across departments.\n\n- **Discovery workshops:** Met with departments to map how work currently moved and where small changes could have a big impact.\n- **Pilot rollout:** Partnered with select teams to migrate existing work and refine structures before scaling organization-wide.\n- **Training and support:** Used the training board and quick reference guides to build comfort through hands-on practice.\n- **Ongoing refinement:** Held short check-ins to review progress, gather feedback, and make small iterative improvements.\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n#### Outcomes {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\nWithin a few months, staff reported noticeable improvements in how work flowed. Projects were easier to track, communication was more transparent, and onboarding new staff took less time.\n\n- Internal emails and texts decreased as conversations moved to Slack.\n- Clearer ownership and fewer missed handoffs across projects.\n- Standardized boards made portfolio-level tracking and reporting faster.\n- Managers could review capacity and priorities without manual check-ins.\n- Staff learned and adopted the new tools faster through structured templates and the training board.\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n#### Services Mapped to Outcomes {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\n- **Systems & Process Optimization:** Created consistency across tools and workflows so teams could collaborate smoothly regardless of department.\n- **Data Management & Quality Control:** Structured task and ownership data allowed for clearer reporting, visibility, and capacity planning.\n- **Donor & Industry Insight:** Improved data flows enabled better tracking of campaign progress and donor engagement activities.\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n#### Representative Artifacts {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\n- Standardized Monday.com templates (General, Events, Training)\n- Slack channel model and quick-start guide\n- "When to use what" reference sheet\n- Adoption snapshot and training participation tracker\n{.case-study__list}\n\n\n#### Next Steps {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\nTrack monthly usage metrics and cross-department activity, introduce deeper Slack–Monday integrations for deadlines and notifications, and continue quarterly feedback loops to refine templates and training materials.\n\n#### Outcome in One Sentence {.case-study__subsection-title}\n\nA shared, predictable system—Slack for communication and Monday.com for projects—helped teams work together with less friction and greater visibility.'}}];var l=t(894),d=t(8027),m=t.n(d);function u(){let e=(0,s.useMemo)(()=>new
