/**
 * ===== INDEX.CSS - APPLICATION ENTRY POINT =====
 * 
 * This is the root CSS file that gets imported into main.jsx.
 * It imports our modular BEM-based styles.
 * 
 * BEM = Block Element Modifier
 * A CSS naming methodology that makes styles more maintainable and scalable.
 * 
 * The styles are now organized into logical modules:
 * - Base: Global resets and typography
 * - Utilities: Reusable helper classes
 * - Components: Individual UI components (header, hero, services, etc.)
