/**
 * ===== LAYOUT UTILITIES =====
 * Common layout patterns and structural helpers
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * These utilities help with overall page structure and scrolling behavior.
 * 
 * SCROLL BEHAVIOR EXPLAINED:
 * The scroll-margin-top on sections ensures that when clicking navigation links,
 * the section doesn't appear right at the top edge (hidden under sticky header).
 * Instead, it leaves space for the header.
 * 
 * WHY 5rem?
 * - The header is 5rem tall (80px)
 * - scroll-margin-top: 5rem pushes the scroll target down by that amount
 * - Result: Perfect alignment when navigating between sections
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * When you click "Services" in navigation, it scrolls to #services
 * but stops 5rem before it, so the header doesn't cover the content.

.main {
  /* Container for all main content sections
   * Acts as a wrapper between header and footer
   * No specific styles needed, just semantic structure
   */
}

/* ===== SCROLL BEHAVIOR ===== */
/* Account for sticky header when scrolling to sections */
section {
  /* Push scroll target down by header height to prevent content
   * from being hidden under the sticky header
   */
  scroll-margin-top: 5rem; /* 80px - matches header height */
}
