# Quick Start Guide - Next.js Migration

## ðŸŽ‰ Your Site is Now SEO-Optimized!

Your personal website now uses **Next.js** for better Google crawlability while keeping the same look and feel.

## What You Get

### SEO URLs (Crawlable by Google)
- `yoursite.com/` - Homepage
- `yoursite.com/services/` - Services page
- `yoursite.com/about/` - About page  
- `yoursite.com/contact/` - Contact page

Each URL:
- âœ… Has unique meta tags
- âœ… Can rank separately in Google
- âœ… Shows as sitelinks in search results
- âœ… Still scrolls smoothly on the same page

## Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Testing Your Site

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to different sections
3. Check the browser title changes for each route
4. Copy/paste URLs like `http://localhost:3000/services/` - they work directly!

## How It Works

When someone visits `/services`:
1. Google sees a real page with "Services - Fitzhugh Analytics" title
2. Page loads with services-specific meta description
3. Client automatically scrolls to services section
4. User sees smooth one-page experience
5. Browser back button works correctly

## Deploy Checklist

- [ ] Test all routes: `/`, `/services`, `/about`, `/contact`
- [ ] Verify meta tags in browser dev tools
- [ ] Check mobile menu functionality
- [ ] Test contact form modal
- [ ] Verify smooth scrolling works
- [ ] Test browser back/forward buttons
