### Challenge {.case-study__section-title}

Provide a campaign-selected group of industry leaders tasked with tasked with moving forward fundraiing goals with clear, actionable insight on an assigned industry to guide recruitment strategy. Use existing data to identify where headroom exists and how to focus volunteer time effectively.

- Align internal donor/corporate data with local economic context
- Identify industries with meaningful headroom for engagement
- Produce guidance that non-technical leaders can use immediately
{.case-study__list}


### Industry Definition {.case-study__section-title}

Selected Industry (NAICS 4‑digit, anonymized). Establishments operating within a specialized professional services category. Includes independent firms and multi‑site organizations across the region.


### Factors Considered {.case-study__section-title}

- Number of establishments and establishment size
- Employment and employment penetration
- Donor, donation/payroll penetration; leadership participation
- Corporate donations and match patterns
- Payroll and average wages; employee giving potential
{.case-study__list}


### Data Sources {.case-study__section-title}

- Internal individual and corporate donor records (2019)
- BLS Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (2019 averages)
- Data Axle business listings
- NAICS classification (U.S. Census Bureau)
{.case-study__list}


### Employment {.case-study__section-title}

Employment penetration compares employees at known accounts to total local employment. Measuring people rather than organizations avoids bias from uneven firm sizes.

- Penetration within this industry was weak relative to the local economy
- Small current footprint implies significant headroom despite niche size
- Attractive average salaries increase the value of potential penetration gains

### Donors & Individual Giving {.case-study__section-title}

Donor participation reflects the percent of people within accounts who give. Percentages are volatile at small counts but still directional. Leadership donors often require more time per relationship and can materially affect totals.

- Donor participation and counts were low; leadership share among donors was high
- Leadership gifts can represent a large portion of individual revenue
- Small denominators amplify percentage swings; interpret trends with caution

### Corporate Giving {.case-study__section-title}

Corporate gifts and matches vary by industry and are often decided by headquarters. They increasingly incentivize participation and can materially shift totals even when donor counts are small.

- Corporate participation was limited but impactful where present
- Matching policies can be a lever for new or increased participation

### Payroll & Giving Potential {.case-study__section-title}

Total payroll indicates scale; giving potential per employee estimates headroom using typical giving rates (e.g., ~1–2% of income), consistent with observed averages.

- Higher-than-average wages suggest above-average per-employee potential
- Combined with low current penetration, the opportunity is attractive
{.case-study__list}


### Conclusion {.case-study__section-title}

This industry is relatively small but offers clear headroom: higher wages, weak current penetration, and leadership‑gift patterns seen in adjacent fields all point to actionable opportunity.

- Focus early outreach on targeted establishments with capacity and leadership prospects
- Use consistent industry metrics and annual refresh to track movement
