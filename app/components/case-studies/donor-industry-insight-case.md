### Challenge

A regional nonprofit with strong employer relationships wanted to expand its workplace-giving reach strategically. The team sought a structured, data-driven approach to identify which industries held the most potential for deeper engagement.

The organization had built extensive donor and campaign data over the years and was ready to connect it to the broader business landscape. Leadership wanted to understand how its donor base aligned with the local economy and where additional outreach could deliver the greatest impact.

- Donor, business, and corporate giving records used different categorization systems and needed a unified framework.
- The organization needed a shared baseline to identify industries with the most growth potential.
- Insights needed to be accessible and actionable for both staff and volunteer leaders.


### Approach

The project developed a unified dataset linking donor information, business listings, and public labor data under a single industry classification system. This alignment made it possible to compare participation and potential across local sectors.

#### Data Integration and Analysis

- **Integrated data sources:** Combined donor, corporate giving, and wage data to provide a full picture of the regional economy.
- **Opportunity scoring:** Weighted employment, wages, donor participation, and leadership giving to identify sectors with the strongest growth potential.
- **Actionable materials:** Produced concise industry summaries and ranked lists that supported planning and recruitment discussions.


#### Day-to-Day Impact

The framework made it easier for staff and volunteers to use data as part of everyday planning. Instead of relying on anecdotal impressions, leadership could view each industry through consistent metrics and focus outreach where opportunity was clearest.

- Industry snapshots clarified where engagement could expand.
- Shared metrics improved coordination across departments.
- Campaign discussions became more data-driven and efficient.


#### Implementation

The analysis was designed to be simple to maintain and repeat annually. Key phases included:

- Aligning donor and business data using a consistent industry classification.
- Calculating participation and wage-based opportunity indicators.
- Summarizing insights into briefs and ranked lists for leadership review.


#### Outcomes

The findings offered new perspective on the local economy and helped leadership focus planning where it could have the most impact.

- Revealed several industries with untapped potential for engagement.
- Provided a replicable process for evaluating opportunity each year.
- Strengthened collaboration between fundraising and research teams.


#### Services Mapped to Outcomes
