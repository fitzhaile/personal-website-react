### Challenge {.case-study__section-title}

As digital presence expanded across multiple properties, the team needed a single, reliable view of acquisition, behavior, and conversions—moving beyond basic traffic into data that could drive confident decisions.

- Campaign data lived across multiple platforms and needed integration into one view
- Standardized conversion tracking and funnel analysis were required
- Cross-site user journeys had to be connected for complete attribution
- Decisions needed to be grounded in consistent, accessible data

### Approach {.case-study__section-title}

Built a comprehensive, event-based analytics foundation: consistent conversion tracking, funnel analysis, cross-site attribution, and accessible dashboards used in everyday planning.


#### Event Configuration & Conversions {.case-study__subsection-title}

- Implemented custom twenty to twenty-five GA4 events for donations, ticketing, form entry, engagement, etc. 
- Based primary conversions on purchase events; defined additional conversions (e.g., contact shares) per Marketing priorities
- KPI set for reports: users, user conversion rate, engagement rate, average engagement time, ARPPU, total revenue
{.case-study__list}


#### Reporting & Funnel Analysis {.case-study__subsection-title}

- Automated reporting for conversion rate, engagement rate, revenue, ARPU, and AOV
- Breakdowns and filters by medium, source, and campaign
- Compared channels to identify initiatives driving the most value
- Mapped drop-off across donation and purchase flows; identified low/high-performing segments
- Funnel exploration with abandonment by step; filterable by acquisition segments (e.g., campaign, medium, source)
- Prioritized optimizations (form simplification, clearer CTAs)

#### Cross-Property Tracking {.case-study__subsection-title}

- Connected journeys across informational and transactional properties to maintain attribution end-to-end
- Linked awareness activities directly to completed actions and donations (outcomes over traffic)
- Differentiated internal referral flows from direct marketing for reporting clarity

#### Non‑Ecommerce Measurement {.case-study__subsection-title}

- Charted KPI metrics (users, user conversion rate, engagement rate, average engagement time, etc.) by medium, source and campaign
- Defined non‑ecommerce conversions (content‑visit journey goals) and computed conversion rates
- Explored funnels for content‑visit journeys with abandonment analysis; segmentable by audience
- Created dashboards snapshot for quick monitoring

#### Audiences & Segmentation {.case-study__subsection-title}

- Planned audiences (e.g., gender, age, device, region, interests)
- Segmented performance by source, medium, campaign, device, and user characteristics
- Added example metrics (e.g., returning users) and segments (e.g., mobile vs. desktop) with room to extend
{.case-study__list}


#### Data Quality & Governance {.case-study__subsection-title}

- Established governance to keep tracking accurate and consistent
- Defined naming, parameter, and event standards to ensure durable reporting
{.case-study__list}


#### Outcomes {.case-study__subsection-title}

- Reliable visibility into acquisition, engagement, and conversion performance
- Dashboards made it clear what changed, why, and where to focus next
- Analytics embedded into day-to-day planning and decision-making
- Built internal dashboards/report templates for non-technical users
- Trained staff and set a regular review cadence for iterative improvement
- Provided an initial GA training session; optional advanced training available as needs evolve
- Delivered: GA4 custom event/conversion config; reporting templates; attribution docs
- Mapped to services: Google Analytics & Campaign Insight; Systems & Process Optimization; Data Management & Quality Control
