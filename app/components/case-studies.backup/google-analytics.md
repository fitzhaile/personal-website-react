<h3 class="case-study__section-title">Challenge</h3>

As the organization's digital presence expanded across multiple properties, the marketing team wanted a comprehensive way to measure campaign performance and understand the complete user journey. They sought a unified analytics framework that could connect activity across sites and provide clear insights into what drove conversions.

The team was ready to move from basic reporting to sophisticated measurement—tracking not just traffic, but understanding acquisition sources, user behavior, and conversion patterns that could guide strategy and resource allocation.

-   Campaign data existed across multiple platforms and needed integration into a unified view.
-   The organization was ready to implement standardized conversion tracking and funnel analysis.
-   Cross-site user journeys needed to be connected for complete attribution visibility.
-   Marketing decisions needed to be supported by comprehensive, data-driven insights.{.case-study__list}

<h3 class="case-study__section-title">Approach</h3>

A comprehensive analytics framework was built from the ground up, implementing event-based measurement, funnel analysis, cross-site tracking, and accessible reporting dashboards.

<h4 class="case-study__subsection-title">Acquisition and Conversion Reporting</h4>

A new event-based measurement strategy was implemented to capture key interactions such as donations, purchases, and engagement actions. The marketing team gained visibility into where users were coming from, how they engaged across channels, and what influenced conversion outcomes.

-   Deployed custom event tracking to measure donations, purchases, and key engagement actions.
-   Built automated reports tracking conversion rate, engagement rate, revenue, and average purchase value.
-   Created segmentation by source, medium, campaign, and user characteristics.
-   Enabled comparison across channels to identify which initiatives drove the most value.{.case-study__list}

<h4 class="case-study__subsection-title">User Behavior and Funnel Analysis</h4>

To help interpret how visitors moved through the purchase and donation process, a series of user funnels was developed to visualize the complete user journey.

-   Mapped drop-off points throughout the donation and purchase process.
-   Analyzed conversion rate variations across acquisition channels and devices.
-   Identified audience segments with the highest and lowest completion rates.
-   Revealed opportunities for optimization such as form simplification and improved calls to action.{.case-study__list}

<h4 class="case-study__subsection-title">Cross-Site Attribution</h4>

An additional layer of work unified tracking across the organization's digital properties to create a complete picture of marketing effectiveness.

-   Mapped user journeys between informational and transactional sites.
-   Passed campaign tracking data across domains to maintain attribution.
-   Connected awareness-driven campaigns directly to completed actions and donations.
-   Enabled the team to identify which marketing activities generated meaningful outcomes, not just traffic.{.case-study__list}

<h4 class="case-study__subsection-title">Day-to-Day Impact</h4>

The new framework consolidated marketing metrics into visual, easily interpreted reports that became part of everyday decision-making.

-   Created dashboards showing what was changing, drivers of change, and where to focus next.
-   Designed reports for non-technical users to interpret trends independently.
-   Made analytics a functional part of everyday planning, not just a reporting exercise.{.case-study__list}
