## Example Template Variables
Your form sends these fields to EmailJS:

- `{{email}}` - From the email input  
- `{{message}}` - From the message textarea

## Troubleshooting
- **Not receiving emails?** Check your spam folder
- **Getting errors?** Make sure all three IDs are correct
- **Need help?** Check the EmailJS documentation: [https://www.emailjs.com/docs/](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/)

## Security Note
The credentials you're adding are **public keys** - they're safe to include in your frontend code. EmailJS handles all the security on their end.
