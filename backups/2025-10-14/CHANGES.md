## What Changed: Warming Up the Website

Made the website feel more personal, human, and approachable—both in copy and design—emphasizing you as a solo consultant rather than a faceless corporation.

## Part 1: Content Changes (Copy)

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **Hero.js** - Main Landing Section
**Before:**
- Headline: "Data-Driven Strategy That works."
- Subtitle: Generic corporate language about "organizations" and "actionable insights"

**After:**
- Headline: "Hi, I'm Fitz. I help you make sense of your data."
- Subtitle: Personal, location-specific ("Savannah-based consultant"), emphasizes partnership and real-world results

#### 2. **Contact.js** - Call-to-Action Section
**Before:**
- Title: "Ready to Get Started?"
- Subtitle: Corporate "transform your organization"
- Button: "Schedule a Free Consultation"

**After:**
- Title: "Let's Work Together"
- Subtitle: "I'd love to hear about your challenges and explore how we can turn your data into a real advantage."
- Button: "Start a Conversation"

#### 3. **ContactModal.js** - Contact Form Modal
**Before:**
- Title: "Give me a shout"
- Description: "Let me know what's on your mind. I'll be in touch shortly."
- Placeholder: "Tell us about your project..."
- Success: "Your inquiry has been received. We will be in touch within 24 hours."

**After:**
- Title: "Let's Connect"
- Description: "Drop me a note about what you're working on—I usually respond within a day."
- Placeholder: "What's on your mind? Tell me about your data challenges..."
- Success: "I got your message and I'll get back to you within a day. Looking forward to chatting!"

### Tone Changes:

- **Before**: Professional but distant, corporate "we" language
- **After**: Personal "I" language, conversational, approachable
- **Key Shift**: From "organizations" to "you", from "consultancy" to "consultant"

### Files Backed Up:
- Hero.js
- Services.js
- About.js
- Contact.js
- ContactModal.js
- hero.css

## Part 2: Visual Design Changes (Look & Feel)

**APPROACH:** Added decorative background graphics to the hero section to create visual interest and warmth.

### Hero Background Graphics:

#### What Changed:
- Added **layered background** with subtle pattern and gradient
- Added **decorative floating circles** in corners (green and navy)
- Creates depth and visual interest without being distracting

#### Design Elements:
1. **Dot Pattern**: Subtle repeating dots for texture (navy and green)
2. **Gradient Overlay**: Diagonal gradient from gray to light blue
3. **Floating Shapes**: Large semi-transparent circles positioned in corners
   - Top right: Green circle (400px)
   - Bottom left: Navy circle (300px)

#### Styling Details:
- All effects are subtle and semi-transparent (3-8% opacity)
- Maintains excellent text readability
- Professional yet visually engaging
- Can easily be replaced with photo background (instructions in CSS comments)

#### Files Modified:
- `hero.css` - Added layered background, decorative shapes, and z-index layering

### Overall Visual Impact:

- **Warmth**: Soft colors and organic shapes create inviting feel
- **Depth**: Layered backgrounds add dimension
- **Professionalism**: Subtle effects maintain business credibility
- **Visual Interest**: Moves away from flat, plain backgrounds
- **Color Palette**: **UNCHANGED** - keeping the professional navy/green scheme
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap pattern for photo background if desired

### To Restore (Remove Graphics):
If you want to revert to the original plain hero:

```bash
# Restore original hero CSS (Hero.js unchanged - copy changes only):
cp backups/2025-10-14/hero.css src/styles/components/hero.css

# Restore other components (if needed):
cp backups/2025-10-14/Contact.js app/components/Contact.js
cp backups/2025-10-14/ContactModal.js app/components/ContactModal.js
```

### To Add Photo Background (Optional):
If you want to use a photo instead of the pattern:

1. Add your photo to `/public/img/` (e.g., `hero-bg.jpg`)
2. In `hero.css`, find the `.hero` background-image property
3. Replace the last two `radial-gradient` lines with: `url('/img/hero-bg.jpg')`
4. Adjust the gradient overlay opacity if needed (currently 0.95)
